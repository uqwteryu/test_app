# Flutter Project Checklist

## Objective

Ensure the app utilizes the provided JSON file for item information and implements authentication functionality for user login and registration.

## Tasks

### 1. Integration of JSON Data

- Verify that the app accesses the JSON file for item information.
- Confirm consistent usage of JSON data for displaying item details.

```json
{
  "id": "skin-2162732",
  "name": "MP7 | Skulls",
  "rarity": {
    "id": "rarity_rare_weapon",
    "name": "Mil-Spec Grade",
    "color": "#4b69ff"
  },
  "paint_index": "11",
  "image": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ByMykel/counter-strike-image-tracker/main/static/panorama/images/econ/default_generated/weapon_mp7_hy_skulls_light_png.png"
}

### 2. Case Sensitivity

- Review and adjust the code to handle any case sensitivity issues within the JSON file.

### 3. Provider Adjustment

- Update the user provider to seamlessly accommodate the JSON data for efficient data management and state handling.

### 4. Case Opening Mechanism

- Revise the case opening functionality to align with the updated JSON data structure.

### 5. Authentication Implementation

- Design and implement authentication functionality for user login.
- Ensure secure handling of user credentials during authentication process.
- Integrate user authentication with the existing app flow.

### 6. Registration Page Creation

- Create a registration page with necessary input fields for user registration.
- Implement validation for user input during registration.
- Connect the registration page to the authentication system for user account creation.

### 7. Python File Integration

- Develop a Python script for credential validation.
- Ensure the Python script runs seamlessly within the Flutter app environment.
- Test the integration to verify the Python script accurately checks the validity of user credentials.
- Handle connections between the Flutter app and the Python script to exchange data securely.

### Additional Notes

- Authentication should include mechanisms such as email/password authentication, social media login (if applicable), or other authentication providers.
- Consider implementing password hashing and salting techniques for enhanced security.
- Provide appropriate error handling and feedback for users during the authentication and registration processes.
- Ensure compliance with relevant security standards and best practices for user authentication and data handling.
- Thoroughly test the authentication and registration flows to identify and address any potential issues or vulnerabilities.
